# **P2P Chess**
___
+ Design and implement a chess game which allows two people to play chess on the different console interface. 
+ For the implementation you have to use classes for the pieces and the board.
+ The game should provide a menu so that the first player can choose a color (white or black). 
+ Then the game starts. It should follow all the chess rules. 
+ The players can move their pieces by typing coordinates. 
+ For example if the pawn is on the a7 square and we want to move it to a5 square, we have to type a7 a5 and the pawn will move. 
+ The same works for all the pieces. 
+ All the necessary checks concerning the validity of the move and the checks should be performed.
